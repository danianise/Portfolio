        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>
            I am a full-stack software engineer with a particular interest in front-end development. I enjoy creating an interface that is not only funtional and user friendly, but also appealing to the eye.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a Bachelor of Business Administration from the Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, 15 years experience in retail customer service, and I have recently completed the Software Engineering Immersive course with General Assembly.
        </p>
        {/* <p>
            Last, but certainly not least, I am a mother of two. I am passionate about creating a better world for my children to grow up in, and I hope that my work in Software Development can reflect this goal.
